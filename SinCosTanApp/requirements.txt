# Plotting library used for all visualizations
pyqtgraph

# --- Qt Bindings ---
# You need *ONE* of the following Qt bindings libraries.
# The provided script example uses PyQt6 by default in the last version.
# If you modify the script to use PyQt5 or PySide6, make sure

# --- Notes ---
# - Versions: Specific versions are not pinned here to allow installation
#   of the latest compatible versions. If you encounter issues or need strict
#   reproducibility, you can pin versions after installation using:
#     pip freeze > requirements_pinned.txt
#   Example of pinned versions (versions might differ on your system):
#   # numpy==1.26.4
#   # pyqtgraph==0.13.3
#   # PyQt6==6.6.1
#   # PyQt6-Qt6==6.6.1
#   # PyQt6-sip==13.6.0

# - PySide6: If you choose PySide6, the command would be:
